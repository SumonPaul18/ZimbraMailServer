#Whitelist or Blacklist a domain or email address on Zimbra Amavis
#Ref: https://bobcares.com/blog/zimbra-amavis-spam-filtering/

1. First, we create two files that will store the domains and email addresses we wish to whitelist or blacklist.

$ sudo touch /opt/zimbra/conf/{whitelist,blacklist}
All whitelists will be in the file /opt/zimbra/conf/whitelist, and the IPs in the blacklist can be seen in the file /opt/zimbra/conf/blacklist.

Example:

$ cat /opt/zimbra/conf/whitelist
bob@example.com example.org
$ cat /opt/zimbra/conf/blacklist
spammer@example.com
fakedomain.com
After that we modify our /opt/zimbra/conf/amavisd.conf by adding the below lines.

read_hash(%whitelist_sender, '/opt/zimbra/conf/whitelist');
read_hash(%blacklist_sender, '/opt/zimbra/conf/blacklist');
After that, we save the changes and restart the Amavis service.

sudo su - zimbra -c "zmamavisdctl restart"
We can then retry to send emails from a domain/address in the blacklist or the ones in the whitelist.

As a result, we will be able to see that mail delivery is fine now.

#How to update a list of trusted MTA networks?
First, we can check the setting for the current list of trustable networks.

$ sudo su - zimbra
$ postconf mynetworks
$ zmprov gs 'zmhostname' zimbraMtaMyNetworks
Next, we can use the following commands to update trustworthy networks in the MTA

$ sudo su - zimbra
$ zmprov ms 'zmhostname' zimbraMtaMyNetworks '127.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.3.0/22'

The zmconfigd will automatically restart the MTA processes after this change is made.
